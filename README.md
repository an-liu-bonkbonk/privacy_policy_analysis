Sentiment Analysis and correlation analysis between sentiment analysis metrics and readability metrics on an existing corpus of privacy policies from 1996 to 2021 using a published dataset in the paper "Privacy Policies Across the Ages: Content and Readability of Privacy Policies 1996--2021" (Wagner, 2022).  

Published paper can be accessed on https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08739  

Original dataset from Wagner, 2022 paper is available on https://zenodo.org/records/7426577  

This project reproduces some of the readability metrics from the txt files (note: only the text files in policies_texts folder are used, not metadata), conducts a sentiment analysis to compute the polarity and subjectivity on the policy texts, and finally conducts a correlation analysis between the reability metrics and sentiment analysis results.
